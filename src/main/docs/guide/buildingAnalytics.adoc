Create a new Grails 5 application for this additional app. For example by using
http://start.grails.org/[Grails Application Forge] or the command line:

[source,bash]
----
$ grails create-app initial-analytics --profile=rest-api
----

For the multi app part of this guide we will need to be able to run both apps simultaneously. To avoid a running port conflict update your `initial-analytics` app `application.yml` to include the following.

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0, tag=serverPort]
----

Create a Domain class `BookPageView` which will keep track of how many times a book has been viewed.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/domain/demo/BookPageView.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/domain/demo/BookPageView.groovy[]
----

As before create default actions for our `BookPageView` leveraging data services.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/BookPageViewDataService.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/services/demo/BookPageViewDataService.groovy[]
----

<1> Use JPA-QL query to perform a projection
<2> Implement update operations using JPA-QL

Add an integration test:

[source,groovy]
.complete-analytics/src/integration-test/groovy/demo/BookPageViewDataServiceSpec.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/src/integration-test/groovy/demo/BookPageViewDataServiceSpec.groovy[]
----
